TiddlyWeb Bag Policy Editor

This is a simple app to allow you to edit the policy of a TiddlyWeb bag.

This works as a standalone (i.e. offline) web app in at least Firefox 3.6 (and under), Safari 4.0.4 (and under). This definitely does not work standalone in Chrome 5.0 due to JavaScript cross-domain security problems.

Dependencies:
jQuery 1.3.x - http://jquery.com
jQuery JSON - http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/
chrjs - http://github.com/tiddlyweb/chrjs
